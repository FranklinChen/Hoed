Raincat-buggy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a playfield for testing the Haskell debugger Hoed on the real-world
program Raincat. Raincat is a game developed by Carnegie Mellon in one semester.
It is challanging to debug this program because IO is involved, it uses external
libraries, and it is lazily evalutated.
